        "text": "<p>Our use of the word context comes from the Getting Things Done methodology. Simply put, <b>a context is any situation in which you could possibly get some things done</b>. Some examples might be:</p><ul><li>At home</li><li>At the office</li><li>Anytime you have a phone available</li><li>A standing meeting with your team members</li><li>When you are out and about in the car</li></ul><p><b>Why:</b> Being reminded of things you cant do anything about is incredibly pointless. As you are getting into your car to leave work is a terrible time to be reminded about a report you have to write; you would spend the whole trip home worrying about it. However, it is a great time to be reminded to buy batteries for your flashlight; you can probably stop off and buy them on your way.</p><p><b>How:</b> Remember the tags we discussed earlier? Well the tags you assign to a heading determine which contexts it occupies. In the <i>next actions list</i>, there is a field for you to choose your current context. There are some standard contexts we have set; you can also add your own later. By default we show you all actions, but by choosing a context you will only see those things you could actually do. Neat, huh?</p><p><b>Example:</b> Lets say you have report to type. You would create a NEXT action heading with the tag :computer: which indicates you need a computer to do it. Now when you choose Computer as a context in the actions list, you will see this task. But you might have a computer at work so the Office context will also show tasks with the :computer: tag. But what if the information you need to write your report is on a shared drive that can only be accessed at work? Then maybe the :office: tag would be more appropriate: it will show up in the Office context but not the Computer context. That way you can operate in the Office context at the office and the Computer context when you are waiting at an airport, riding a train, or in any other situation with a computer that doesnt have its own context defined.</p>",
